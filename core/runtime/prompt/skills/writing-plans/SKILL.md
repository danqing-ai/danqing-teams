# Writing Plans

> Adapted from obra/superpowers `writing-plans` (© Jesse Vincent / contributors, MIT).
> Rewritten for DanQing Teams tools and agents; not a verbatim copy.

Write plans that a skilled engineer with little repo context can execute: exact files, concrete steps, tests, and commands. Prefer DRY, YAGNI, TDD, frequent commits.

## Workflow

1. **Explore** — map relevant files with `glob` / `grep` / `read_file`. Follow existing patterns.
2. **Scope check** — if the work spans independent subsystems, propose separate plans (each delivers testable value).
3. **File map** — list create/modify/test paths and each file’s responsibility before tasks.
4. **Tasks** — bite-sized units with their own test cycle; each ends in an independently verifiable deliverable.
5. **Self-review** — spec coverage, no placeholders, consistent names/types across tasks.
6. **Handoff** — save the plan if the user wants a file; otherwise deliver in chat and ask whether to implement.

## Plan header (required)

```markdown
# [Feature] Implementation Plan

**Goal:** one sentence
**Architecture:** 2–3 sentences
**Tech stack:** key pieces
**Constraints:** version floors, naming, platforms (verbatim from spec)
```

## Task template

```markdown
### Task N: [Name]

**Files:**
- Create: `path`
- Modify: `path` (why)
- Test: `path`

**Steps:**
- [ ] Write failing test (show code or exact assertion)
- [ ] Run test — expect FAIL for reason X (exact command)
- [ ] Minimal implementation (show code or precise edit)
- [ ] Run test — expect PASS (exact command)
- [ ] Commit message suggestion
```

## No placeholders

Never leave: TBD/TODO, “add appropriate validation”, “write tests for the above” without actual tests, “similar to Task N”, or steps without exact paths/commands.

## Anti-patterns

- Vague “update the service layer” without files
- Giant tasks that mix unrelated deliverables
- Plans that assume unspoken domain knowledge
- Skipping self-review for type/name drift across tasks

## Stop condition

Deliver the complete plan (and path if saved). Offer to implement next; do not start coding inside this skill unless the user already approved execution.
